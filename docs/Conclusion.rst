Conclusion
**********

**KupenStack** is proposed with the vision of making Cloud Native OpenStack which can be used in various
use cases e.g. Hybrid Academic cloud, Edge, Multi-cloud, 5G etc. KupenStack can also be used with many open source
projects like Airship, StarlingX, Magma etc. and work as an interoperability layer among many projects. This is the first
version of KupenStack in which we have mapped various OpenStack resources with Kubernetes and in future, we will
map more. We will continue our work on KupenStack and make our future work public through this repo and also 
continue our implementation with other projects like KubeFed, Airship, etc.
